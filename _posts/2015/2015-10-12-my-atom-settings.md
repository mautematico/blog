Just in case any of we (because I'm also one of the _we_ set) wish to see my **atom.io** settings, I have them on a github's gist.

{% gist 51409ae96652705e33a6 %}

You can get a copy of my (I hope up to date and complete) relevant config at [https://gist.github.com/mautematico/51409ae96652705e33a6](https://gist.github.com/mautematico/51409ae96652705e33a6)

By now the gist is maintained by an atom.io's plugin, **sync-settings**. This plugin gives you the option to _backup_ (upload) your atom settings to a github's gist. Also it offers you the chance to _restore_ (download) your configuration from the same gist.

This plugin is not actually a sync tool yet, but I think it's on it's own way there... And I hope it'll be there soon. :simile:

May be I'll post again about this plugin to show you how to use it. Meanwhile, you can of course give it a look to atom.io sync-settings description, at [https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings)
